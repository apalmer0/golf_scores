- scope tournaments to somehow check for new tournaments - no data points? (tournament.data_points.uniq.count == 0)
- scope data source to somehow check for those that haven't been pulled yet (data_source.data_points.count == 0)
-- but what if you add a new data source without a new tournament? you'd have to run all the tournaments again.
-- so you need to run all tournaments for which there's at least one data source with 0 data points.
-- but if you just add a tournament without changing the data sources, then you'd only have tournaments with
-- data sources with all data points already pulled.

-- what about tournaments where data_sources.uniq.count != data_sources.count?
-- data sources come from data points, so adding a new data source would make all tournaments qualify,
-- and new tournaments would have 0 data points and therefore 0 data sources
** that's the scope for tournaments. now how to write it...

-- what's the scope for data sources? you've got the tournaments you want to run, which data sources do you pull?
-- this will have to be a function of the tournament, right?
-- data sources for which there are no data points for that tournament?
-- any data sources that aren't already accounted for in the tournament


- run scrape_everything any time tournament or data source changes?
- run correlations
- provide output - what format?
- get results for each tournament - where?
- run scrape_everything in sidekiq to get all data. maybe delay between calls even more? going to be 3975 calls currently.
